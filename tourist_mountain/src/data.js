        description: "Mount Aconcagua, on the Chilean border in west-central Argentina, is the highest point in both South America and the Western Hemisphere, but its precise elevation has been debated since the early 20th century. In January 2001 a team of scientists using advanced GPS (global positioning system) technology reported an elevation of 22,840 feet (6,962 meters), plus or minus 16 feet (5 meters), but neither Argentina’s government nor the National Geographic Society recognizes this figure; the 22,831 feet (6,959 meters) height established by the Military Geographical Institute of Argentina remains the generally accepted figure. Mount Aconcagua has two summits—north and south—connected by a ridge. The southern summit has been measured at 22,736 feet (6,930 meters). The higher northern summit was first reached in 1897 by Swiss climber Matthias Zurbriggen.",

Situated in Kosciuszko National Park, it rises to an elevation of 7,310 feet (2,228 meters). Nearby are Mounts Townsend, Twynam, North Ramshead, and Carruthers, all of which top 7,000 feet (2,130 meters) in elevation. The first European to scale Mount Kosciuszko was Polish explorer and geologist Paul Strzelecki, who made the climb in 1840 and named the mountain after Polish patriot and hero of the American Revolution Tadeusz Kościuszko.",

        description: "In Nunavut and other far-north areas of Canada, the landscape is dotted with inuksuit built by the Inuit peoples for communication. An inuksuk is typically an anthropoid figure formed of stacked rocks and is visible from great distances in the territory, where there are few trees or other landmarks. Many inuksuit are quite ancient; they have been found near archaeological sites that date from 2400 to 1800 BCE! Inuksuit are still used for hunting and navigation, and some of the figures are of spiritual importance. The flag of Nunavut (which is home to the world's northernmost permanently inhabited city) and badges and other symbols of several local organizations incorporate this amazing emblem of Arctic survival.",
